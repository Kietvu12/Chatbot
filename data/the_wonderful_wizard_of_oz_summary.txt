The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a children's novel written by L. Frank Baum. The story follows a young girl named Dorothy who lives on a Kansas farm with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and her little dog Toto. A cyclone hits, and Dorothy and Toto are swept away to the magical land of Oz.

In Oz, Dorothy meets the Good Witch of the North and is given silver shoes and a protective kiss. She is advised to follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City to seek the help of the Wizard of Oz to return home. Along her journey, she befriends the Scarecrow, who desires a brain, the Tin Woodman, who longs for a heart, and the Cowardly Lion, who seeks courage.

The group faces various challenges but eventually reaches the Emerald City. The Wizard appears in different forms to each of them and agrees to grant their wishes if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West. They manage to defeat the Witch by melting her with water.

Upon their return to the Emerald City, they discover the Wizard is an ordinary man from Omaha. He grants their wishes through symbolic means: the Scarecrow gets a brain made of bran, the Tin Woodman gets a silk heart, and the Lion receives a potion for courage. Dorothy learns that the silver shoes can take her home. She clicks her heels together and returns to Kansas, where she is joyfully reunited with her family.
